# Demoscene

\
The demoscene is a worldwide non-commercial network of creative minds involved in the making of so called 'demos'. Demos are computer generated music clips that show what kind of graphic and sound effects can really be done by using high-end computer hardware to its full potential.

Demo-making is teamwork. As demos are rather complex any helping hand is welcome. Each scener provides the team with different skills. Graphicians and musicians create suitable pieces of art, the programmers fit all the parts together in an extensive amount of detail work to finally make it an executable program: the demo.

The sceners don't necessarily have to physically meet each other at all during the whole process. Usually they meet in chatrooms and share their latest work over the internet.
